## 8. Spaced Repetition System (SRS) Review Mode
The vocabulary page includes a built-in review mode to help users study their saved words.
- **Review Setup**: Users can initiate a review session for either all saved words or a selection of specific songs.
- **Weighted Randomization**: The system uses a weighted random selection algorithm to draw cards. Words with a lower `proficiency` score are more likely to be shown, ensuring that users focus on the material they know least.
- **Interactive Card Review**: During a review, the user is first shown the front of a card. After flipping the card to see the back, they are presented with four options to rate their recall.
- **Proficiency Rating**: The user can rate their proficiency for each card as "Lowest," "-1," "+1," or "Highest." This rating updates the card's `proficiency` score in the database, directly influencing how often it will appear in future review sessions.
