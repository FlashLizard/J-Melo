## 7. Advanced Vocabulary Management
The vocabulary page is a full-featured tool for reviewing, organizing, and exporting saved words.
- **Multiple Display Modes**: Users can view their vocabulary as a flat list ("All"), grouped by the song they originated from ("By Song"), or filtered by a search term ("Search").
- **Card Viewer with Carousel**: Clicking a card opens a dedicated viewer. This viewer includes "Previous" and "Next" buttons, allowing users to easily navigate through the currently displayed set of cards without returning to the main list.
- **Inline Card Editing**: Within the card viewer, users can switch to an edit mode to directly modify the front and back content of a flashcard.
- **Bulk Actions**: A selection mode enables users to perform actions on multiple cards at once. This includes:
  - Checkboxes for individual card selection.
  - A "Select All" option.
  - In the "By Song" view, selecting a song automatically selects all cards from that song.
  - Actions for deleting or exporting all selected cards.
